# INFO-5100-AED-Final-Project

## SOCIAL WELFARE SYSTEM

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. Lack of availability of a centralized platform for community well-being.
2. Lack of integration between organizations like Hospital, Distributor, NGO, Blood Banks
3. This creates a lot of gaps when a patient is in grave need of blood, funds, medical camps and other healthcare services.

## SOLUTION

1. We’re providing a centralized, integrated and global solution to solve the current challenges faced in healthcare sector. 
2. At “Social Welfare System”, we aim to bring together all the entities – Hospital, NGO, Distributor, Drug Store, Rehab and Blood Banks for identifying and addressing the stakeholders hassles. 
3. We aspire to minimize the end-to-end lifecycle of a patient receiving different healthcare services right from laboratory tests, supply of prescription drugs through a network of distributors to blood receival/blood donation from blood banks and the required funds from NGOs as needed.
